Laravel-Startup
===============

My development blank for making an app with [Laravel Framework](http://www.laravel.com) using [S.O.L.I.D principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) on top of [Hexagonal architecture](http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture).

Be cleaner as you can and use any applied software architecture just like [Hexagonal architecture](http://fideloper.com/hexagonal-architecture)...

Most codes have brought by [Chris Fidao](http://fideloper.com/)'s [github repository](https://github.com/fideloper) "[hexagonal-php](https://github.com/fideloper/hexagonal-php)".
So, Thanks Fideloper...
